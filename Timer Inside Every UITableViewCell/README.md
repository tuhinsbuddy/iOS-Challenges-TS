This is the first test which can be asked to the candidate in an iOS interview. Following are the scenerio and this folder of the main repository itself is the solution.


1. Create a tableview with each cell displaying a Label of countdown timer.

2. The data in each cell will be added when you click on Add item button just below the tableview.

3. Each countdown timer will start from 200000 seconds and will come down to 0 second.

4. When the countdown hits 0 sec it should remove the row from the tableview showing an alert view “Your time is up”.

5. The state in each row should be saved when we scroll through items. i.e. when we scroll through tableview the countdown timer should not be refreshed with minimum 30+ rows.



To run on the system 

    1. first try to Clone the repository/download zip using the "Clone or download" button. 
    2. Open the folder called "Timer Inside Every UITableViewCell".

    4. Choose the desired device from "Scheme Name" -> "Device Name" on which you want to run the project.
    4. Now press ⌘+R to run on a device/simulator.
